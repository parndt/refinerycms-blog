## Dependencies

RefineryCMS blog's gem requirements are:

* [fattr](http://github.com/ahoward/fattr)
* [rMagick](http://rubygems.org/gems/rmagick) (a Refinery dependency; this should be already installed)

Instructions for installing these gems follows below.

### Tags

You need to install [http://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on](http://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on)

> gem install -v=2.0.2 acts-as-taggable-on

add the line:

> gem "acts-as-taggable-on", "2.0.2"

to your Gemfile

> bundle install

If you are already using acts-as-taggable-on in your app, you may want to remove the migration file for "tags/taggings" tables.

### Captcha

The Captcha use Raptcha, a really cool "one file lib" that just work from ahoward @ [http://github.com/ahoward/raptcha](http://github.com/ahoward/raptcha)
If you want to use Captcha, you need [rMagick](http://rubygems.org/gems/rmagick) (which is already a dependency of RefineryCMS) and [fattr](http://github.com/ahoward/fattr):

> gem install fattr

add the line:

> gem "fattr"

to your Gemfile

> bundle install

_The lib is located at /lib/raptcha.rb, you can update it or edit to fit your need._
